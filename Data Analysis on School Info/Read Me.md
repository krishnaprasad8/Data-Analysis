In accomplishing this project, we plan to create tables and graphs to explain the dataset. We will also create a geographic map to visualize the location of the universities. To create the map, we would be using geodata from us-cities. Graphs and tables would be created using python and I would be creating the map using the python folium package. 

Additional Dataset used is United States cities databases which has city name and ID, state name, latitude, longitude etc.
